I am a highly skilled Site Reliability Engineer and Data Engineer with over 14 years of experience working on mission-critical systems, within one of the largest telecommunications companies in Latin America. I propose to contribute to the United States by enhancing the reliability, scalability, and automation of digital infrastructure in key sectors such as healthcare, public safety, and telecommunications.
In the short term, I intend to support U.S.-based organizations in Data Reliability Engineer or Site Reliability Engineer role, applying modern engineering practices and optimizing essential services and deploying a centralized 'Reliability Hub' of Infrastructure-as-Code templates to standardize security and automation. In the long term, I aspire to co-found a U.S.-based technology company dedicated to exporting American cloud-native and AI-driven reliability solutions, fostering innovation
